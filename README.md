Java 8 Associate Certification Guide (Cheat sheet)

I created these notes during preperation for my exam.
The purpose of sharing this material is to help developers who want to appear in this exam.
The material was collected from various books and sites, thanks to all of them.
Unfortunately I do not have the list of sources to give credits to but will try to compile it later.

Please use at your own risk.

Good Luck!
